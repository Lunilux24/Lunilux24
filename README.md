## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is [Bassim Beshry](https://bassim-beshry.vercel.app/) and I'm a Computer Science graduate from UBC, passionate about aerospace, robotics, and networking. My goal is to work on projects that intersect with hardware and software.

I have a passion for drones and robots which led me to join the Aerial Robotics club at my Uni. I worked with the team for 2 years and learned lots about building drones while building many relationships in the field! Iâ€™ve contributed to writing software, enhancing my expertise in computer vision, networking, and autonomous systems. I excel when working with other individuals and am actively working towards entering this field as my career path. 

I have recently picked up homelabbing as a hobby and have been diving into the rabbit hole of all the beautiful self hosted applications there are out there!

Outside of computer related work, I like to swim, race F1 cars on my racing simulator and read novels; with some of my favorites being the Game of Thrones series by George RR Martin and The Sound of Waves by Yukio Mishima. 

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- A budgeting app to help me manage my money better. More information on this project to come in the near future!
- A Homelab for my house with self-hosted applications like a private media server, file server and network montioring tools.
- Getting my advance pilot certificate for Canadian drone pilots.
