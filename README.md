## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bassim Beshry and I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at UBC, passionate about aerospace, robotics, and autonomous systems. My goal is to push the boundaries of drone technology and software in the robotics industry.

I have a passion for drones and robots which led me to join the Aerial Robotics club at my Uni. I have worked with the team for almost 2 years now and have learned lots about building drones and built many relationships in the field! Iâ€™ve contributed to writing software, enhancing my expertise in computer vision, path planning, and real-time systems. I excel when working with other individuals and aim to continue working in this field post-graduation.

Outside of school, I like to swim, race F1 cars on my racing simulator and read novels; with some of my favorites being the Game of Thrones series by George RR Martin and The Sound of Waves by Yukio Mishima. 

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- An instant messaging platform that uses UDP and TCP to communicate between clients. I started this project because I took a networking class and really enjoyed learning about how communication works online. I am putting the finishing touches on the project. Take a look at the repository for more details!
- A budgeting app to help me manage my money better. More information on this project to come in the near future!
- Software for the Aerial Robotics Club at my school. I can't share too many details as it's classified, however I recently completed development on a search algorithm that the drone can use to survey a field for our upcoming UAS competition.
- Getting my advance pilot certificate for Canadian drone pilots.
- A few more secret projects...
