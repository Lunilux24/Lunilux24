## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is [Bassim Beshry](https://bassim-beshry.vercel.app/) and I'm a Computer Science graduate from UBC, passionate about networking and cloud engineering. I appreciate clean code and automated development pipelines. Throughout all my work, I strive to apply these two core principles to ensure a robust and organized development process. My most recent project was an [F1 Telemetry Aggregator](https://github.com/Lunilux24/F1-Telemetry-Aggregator) where through applying these core principles, I was able to increase code reliability through rigorous testing and observation.

I have a passion for drones and robots which led me to join the Aerial Robotics club at my Uni. I worked with the team for 2 years and learned lots about building drone software while creating many relationships in the field! My time contributing to the UBCO Aerospace club enhanced my expertise in computer vision, networking, and autonomous systems. Once I graduated, my experience using tools such as Docker and ZeroMQ pushed me towards the hobby of homelabbing where my love for networking and cloud engineering was elevated even more! After diving into the rabbit hole of cloud platforms, containerization, and CI/CD, I found that my passion for utilizing a complex skillset, in collaboration with my eagerness to learn more about these technologies, was best utilized as a cloud engineer. I want to focus on impacting businesses positively, contributing to cloud infrastructure that will lower costs, improve efficiency and security, and challenge my ability to innovate. 

Apart from my career aspirations, I enjoy lane swimming, sim racing and experiencing stories filled with complex lore. My favorite book is The Sound of Waves by Yukio Mishima and some of my favorite games include Destiny 2 and the Nier series for their deep and rich lore.
