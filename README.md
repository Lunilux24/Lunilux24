## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bassim Beshry and I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at UBC, passionate about aerospace, robotics, and autonomous systems. My goal is to push the boundaries of drone technology and software in the robotics industry

I have a passion for drones and robots which led me to join the Aerial Robotics club at my Uni. I have worked with the team for almost 2 years now and have learned lots about drones and built many relationships in the field! Iâ€™ve contributed to writing drone software, enhancing my expertise in computer vision, path planning, and real-time systems. I thrive in collaborative, high-impact projects and aim to continue working in this field post-graduation.

Outside of school, I like to swim, race cars on my simulator and read fantasy novels; with my favorites being Game of Thrones and the Lord of the Rings. 

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- An instant messaging platform that uses UDP and TCP to communicate between clients. I started this project because I took a networking class and really enjoyed learning about how communication works online. I am putting the finishing touches on the project. Take a look at the repository for more details!
- Software for the Aerial Robotics Club at my school. I can't share too many details as it's classified, however I recently completed development on a search algorithm that the drone can use to survey a field for our upcoming UAS competition.
- Getting my advance pilot certificate for Canadian drone pilots.
- A few more secret projects for school...
